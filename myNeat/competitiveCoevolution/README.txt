This software is comprised of code for
Competitive Coevolution experiments by Drew Kirkpatrick,
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topology (NEAT) code
based upon the implementation described in
Mat Buckland's book "AI Techniques for Game Programming",
and modified NCD code from www.complearn.org,
written by Rudi Cilibrasi.

Thanks:
Many people have provided guidance in this project, be it
through helpful tips and support, previous research, or software and
books.
In no particular order I would like to thank a few of them:

Dr. Ken Stanley:
For help recreating his competitive coevolution experiment,
and numerous helpful tips on NEAT implementation.

Dr. Rudi Cilibrasi:
For his work on NCD (Normalized Compression Distance), and
for allowing me access to his software under a friendly license.

Mat Buckland:
For his excellent books in game programming, particularly his
AI books, which interested me in the topic of AI in the first place.

Dr. Stephane Doncieux:
For his work in behavior characterization, and pointing me
in the direction of NCD applications in NEAT

Colin Green:
For his helpful insight into NEAT applications.

Dr. Danny Weddle:
My Thesis advisor. Ever a patient man.

Dr. David Mutschler:
For participating on yet another of my graduate
research committees.

Dr. Vernon Gordon:
For his work sitting as a member of my thesis committee.

Dr. Anene Nnolim:
Director of the campus of Florida Tech I attend, and for his
help advising me.

Pat Gatewood:
My boss, who has suffered through my endless weekend warrior
grad school episodes, offered helpful insight, and allowed me
access to considerable computational resources for running
simulations. He also taught me how to program when I was a
simple psychologist.

Dr. Janet Nye:
My patient and loving wife, who has drawn the line and said
"No more school after this one". Smart woman.
