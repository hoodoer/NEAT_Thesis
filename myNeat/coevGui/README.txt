This gui software is "abandonware", it's not longer supported. 
Doesn't work at the moment either, but it wouldn't be too
difficult to get it going again if it's needed.

It connects to the competitive coevolution experiment
over a TCP connection to display realtime data about
what's going on in the simulations, and to allow control.
